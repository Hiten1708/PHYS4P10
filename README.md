## Project 4: Long-Term Trends and Influences in Atmospheric Data

### Overview

This project involves analyzing atmospheric data spanning various zones and incorporating insights from solar activity and atmospheric transparency. The data includes temperature variations in the lower stratosphere, mid-troposphere, and lower troposphere, as well as sunspot count and sunspot area data. The analysis is performed using Jupyter notebooks, with a portion of the code implemented in C programming for efficiency.

### Data Processing

The code begins by reading data from different files, extracting relevant columns, and transforming the data into decimal years for consistency.

### Temperature and Sunspot Analysis

Two subplots are created to visualize changes in global average atmospheric temperatures and sunspot activity over the years. The temperature data is segmented into lower stratosphere, mid-troposphere, and lower troposphere. Sunspot count and sunspot area data are plotted on a dual y-axis subplot.

### Correlation Analysis

Correlation coefficients are calculated to assess the relationship between temperature and sunspot activity. Cross-covariance analysis is performed to determine time lags in the correlation between temperature and sunspot counts.

### Linear Regression and Residual Analysis

The code includes linear regression analysis to assess long-term trends in temperature. Residuals are calculated, and linear fits are plotted for lower stratosphere, mid-troposphere, and lower troposphere temperatures against sunspot counts and atmospheric transparency.

### Slope Analysis and Significance Testing

Long-term trends are assessed using slope analysis with 95% confidence intervals. The significance of slopes in atmospheric transparency is discussed in the context of Earth's radiative energy balance.

### Regression Estimates and Influences on Temperature

The code calculates regression estimates to compare the influences of solar activity and atmospheric transparency on temperature in each atmospheric zone. The magnitude of regression estimates is interpreted to determine the strength of each influencer's impact.
