## Project 1: Introduction to C Programming

### Overview

In the first homework project, you delved into the fundamentals of C programming to develop a program that generates a Gaussian wave packet impacting an energy barrier. The project is structured as follows:

1. **JavaScript Initialization:**
   - Used JavaScript to configure the notebook environment, specifically defining a function (`IPython.tab_as_tab_everywhere`) to set tab usage preferences for CodeMirror instances.

2. **Bash Commands:**
   - Created a directory (`5P10`) if it didn't exist and navigated into it.
   - Removed and recreated a directory (`packet`) for storing project files.

3. **Fortran Code (`add_wave.f`):**
   - Developed a Fortran subroutine (`add_wave`) to add a specified wave to a complex storage array.
   - Implemented a wave packet with defined coefficients based on given boundary conditions.
   - Utilized loops to calculate the wave function values at different regions (left, inside, right of the barrier).

4. **Makefile (`Makefile`):**
   - Defined compiler flags, libraries, and rules for building the `packet` program.
   - Incorporated a default implicit rule for converting `.c` files to object files.

5. **C Code (`packet.c`):**
   - Created a C program to generate a Gaussian wave packet impacting an energy barrier.
   - Implemented command-line options for customization (e.g., number of waves, time, barrier height, etc.).
   - Calculated wave function amplitudes and coefficients based on given parameters.
   - Ensured validity checks for input values and terminated with informative error messages.

6. **Gnuplot Script (`gnuplot`):**
   - Generated a Gnuplot script to visualize the scattering of the Gaussian wave packet at different time steps.
   - Plotted the potential energy (`V(x)`) and the wave packet at specific time intervals.

### How to Run

To execute the simulation and visualize the results, you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (e.g., Fortran compiler, Gnuplot).
2. Run the provided Bash commands and compile the `packet` program using the provided Makefile (`make packet`).
3. Execute the `packet` program with desired command-line options to customize the simulation.
4. Run the Gnuplot script to visualize the scattering of the Gaussian wave packet.

Feel free to explore and modify the parameters to observe different scenarios in the wave packet simulation. ðŸŒŠðŸ”¬


## Project 2: Determining the Gravitational Constant (G) from Henry Cavendish's Experiment

### Overview

In the second homework project, you conducted a computational analysis of Henry Cavendish's experiment to determine the gravitational constant (G). The project is outlined as follows:

### Gnuplot Script 1

1. **Data Fitting:**
   - Utilized Gnuplot to fit a sinusoidal function (`S(t)`) to experimental data from Cavendish's experiment.
   - Fitted two datasets corresponding to forward and reverse motions, obtaining parameters (`So`, `A`, `tau`, `T`, `b`).

2. **Visualization:**
   - Plotted the experimental data points and the fitted sinusoidal function for both forward and reverse motions.

### Computation of Gravitational Constant (G)

1. **Mathematical Model:**
   - Employed the fitted parameters to calculate G using the equation provided in the manual.

   $$ G = \pi^2 \Delta S b^2 \frac{(d^2 + \frac{2}{5}r^2)}{T^2 m_1 L d} $$

## Project 3: Determining the Gravitational Constant (G) from Henry Cavendish's Experiment - Computational Analysis using Octave

### Octave Script

You provided an Octave script that performs a computational analysis of Henry Cavendish's experiment. The script includes data processing, plotting, curve fitting, and the calculation of the gravitational constant. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

### Data Processing and Plotting

1. **Data Import:**
   - Imported forward and reverse data from files, ignoring header lines.
   - Stored time (`t1`, `t2`) and position (`p1`, `p2`) values.

2. **Plotting:**
   - Plotted the forward and reverse data on separate subplots.
   - Created a third subplot with both forward and reverse data.

### Curve Fitting and Parameter Extraction

1. **Model Function Definition:**
   - Defined model functions (`s_t1`, `s_t2`) representing the assumed equation of motion for forward and reverse motions.

2. **Curve Fitting:**
   - Used the `nonlin_curvefit` function to fit the model to the data and extract parameters.
   - Displayed the fitted parameters for both forward and reverse motions.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Plotted the fitted curves along with the original data on separate plots.

### Gravitational Constant Calculation

1. **Gravitational Constant Equation:**
   - Used the equation provided in the manual to calculate G.

$$ G = \pi^2 \Delta S b^2 \frac{(d^2 + \frac{2}{5}r^2)}{T^2 m_1 L d} $$

## Project 4: Long-Term Trends and Influences in Atmospheric Data

### Overview

This project involves analyzing atmospheric data spanning various zones and incorporating insights from solar activity and atmospheric transparency. The data includes temperature variations in the lower stratosphere, mid-troposphere, and lower troposphere, as well as sunspot count and sunspot area data. The analysis is performed using Jupyter notebooks, with a portion of the code implemented in C programming for efficiency.

### Data Processing

The code begins by reading data from different files, extracting relevant columns, and transforming the data into decimal years for consistency.

### Temperature and Sunspot Analysis

Two subplots are created to visualize changes in global average atmospheric temperatures and sunspot activity over the years. The temperature data is segmented into lower stratosphere, mid-troposphere, and lower troposphere. Sunspot count and sunspot area data are plotted on a dual y-axis subplot.

### Correlation Analysis

Correlation coefficients are calculated to assess the relationship between temperature and sunspot activity. Cross-covariance analysis is performed to determine time lags in the correlation between temperature and sunspot counts.

### Linear Regression and Residual Analysis

The code includes linear regression analysis to assess long-term trends in temperature. Residuals are calculated, and linear fits are plotted for lower stratosphere, mid-troposphere, and lower troposphere temperatures against sunspot counts and atmospheric transparency.

### Slope Analysis and Significance Testing

Long-term trends are assessed using slope analysis with 95% confidence intervals. The significance of slopes in atmospheric transparency is discussed in the context of Earth's radiative energy balance.

### Regression Estimates and Influences on Temperature

The code calculates regression estimates to compare the influences of solar activity and atmospheric transparency on temperature in each atmospheric zone. The magnitude of regression estimates is interpreted to determine the strength of each influencer's impact.
